# Company Policies Overview

## Remote Work Policy
Our company supports a flexible remote work environment for eligible employees. Employees wishing to work remotely must submit a request to their manager for approval. Approval is contingent on job role compatibility, team needs, and maintaining productivity standards. Regular check-ins and communication are essential for remote team members.

## Vacation Policy
Full-time employees are entitled to 15 days of paid vacation leave per year, accruing at a rate of 1.25 days per month. Vacation requests must be submitted at least two weeks in advance through the HR portal and approved by your direct manager. Unused vacation days can be carried over for up to 5 days into the next calendar year.

## Expense Reimbursement
Employees are eligible for reimbursement of reasonable business expenses incurred while performing their duties. All expenses must be pre-approved by a manager for amounts over $100 and must be submitted with valid receipts within 30 days of the expense date using the designated expense reporting system.

How to Reset Your Account Password

If you have forgotten your password or wish to change it for security reasons, please follow these steps:

1.  **Navigate to the Login Page:** Go to the main login page for our internal systems (e.g., `https://yourcompany.com/login`).
2.  **Click "Forgot Password":** Locate and click the "Forgot Password" or "Reset Password" link, usually found below the login fields.
3.  **Enter Your Username/Email:** You will be prompted to enter your registered username or email address. This is the email associated with your company account.
4.  **Check Your Email:** An email containing a password reset link will be sent to the email address you provided. Please check your spam or junk folder if you don't receive it within a few minutes.
5.  **Click the Reset Link:** Open the email and click on the provided password reset link. This link is typically valid for a limited time (e.g., 24 hours).
6.  **Create New Password:** You will be redirected to a page where you can set a new password. Ensure your new password meets the security requirements (e.g., minimum 8 characters, mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols).
7.  **Confirm New Password:** Re-enter your new password to confirm it.
8.  **Login with New Password:** Once successfully updated, you can return to the login page and sign in with your new password.
